Sometime during the 2nd semester, IIT Bombay Sports will release the poster of MAC+BMC. Many
people will preregister for it; most will ditch in the end. Sorry Sports Council; but even you people
are/were clueless for the most part of it. Thus for people who want to be informed travelers
(unlike wanderer’s like us). This is the main motive of this post that future batches participation increases
in these courses and they don’t back out due to insufficient information is given.

The adventure course at JIM is bliss to show your love for mountains. It’s a 13-day package of activities and training. Helps to learn and know more about mountains filled with a bag full of adventure activities.
Adventure course will provide you with basic knowledge regarding the maximum activities. Some of
them being:-

1)Rappelling
2)Rock Climbing
3)River Crossing
4)Camping/Tenting
5)Climbing by Ascender


Not only a hand in all these activities but with all the basic theoretical and technical knowledge to live in the mountains. You will also get to watch movies related to Mountaineering as and when the weather is bad.One of the instructors there; she herself has climbed Everest.


There will be lectures too; topics being.
1)Do’s and Dont’s of Mountaineering ;
2)Mountaineering Manners
3)Types of Shelters
4)Efficient Load packing
5)Mountaineering Terms

Mountains and nature always turn to be great in bringing positivity and course help you provide that with an add-on to your desire of indulging in adventure activities. For me after a really tough first
year; it worked out wonders. It is the place where you come above your fear, be it in any way within you.

Also with the group of trainees who will come up to be in your batch will become your new family giving you lots of memories and friends for your lifetime. Although being from my part of experience it could be best to do to get a whole lot of things on a single door and that too, on a very affordable price.



WHY MAC OVER BMC
**I HAVE NOT BEEN TO BMC; SO WHATEVER OPINIONS I HAVE BUILT ARE BUILT AFTER LISTENING TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE DONE IT AND OF COURSE LOT OF BROWSING**
1)Physical Fitness not up to the mark
1 Year of NSO-TT and irregular swimming isn’t sufficient to cover up all the rust of 11th and 12th. Jokes apart; seriously not many people I know are in the physical shape to do BMC.If one trains really hard in the month of May; then it might be possible.

2)Number of Days
MAC is 15 days; including traveling at most 18 days. Being in my freshie year; I obviously want to stay home for a few days. BMC meanwhile is for almost a month; in slow clad mountains; living in tents, etc. That was too much rigour for me

3)Enjoyment Part
According to whatever I have heard; the enjoyment you get in BMC is more or less the enjoyment of
successfully going through pain/ pain of rigor.(Of which I had enough during the semester :P )

HOW TO REACH
Life Hack:-
1)Flights from Delhi are considerably cheaper, and there is a train from Delhi to Jammu which is cheap.
2)For summer flights; best fares can be secured around 47 days before departure.

I went for the MAC conducted during 9th-23rd May 2019 held at Sanasar , Jammu.

Possible Ways To Reach The Campsite
1)Flight till Jammu Airport; Take a cab from Airport to Bus Stand. If you take a bus from Jammu to
Sanasar; then it has to be a break journey; it will cost you around 200 bucks(150+50)
Buses don’t run on Wednesdays and Sundays because only military convoys are permitted on those days.
2)Cab from Jammu to Sanasar.It will cost you around 3000-4000 bucks.A tad bit expensive but very
convenient especially you are 3-4 people.
3)There is a train from Delhi to Udhampur; from where you can take a cab till Sanasar

Things Which They Provide Which You Shouldn’t Carry:-
Raincoat, trekking rucksack; trekking equipment, everything is provided by JIM
Please keep your ego and foul language(which I'm sure you must’ve built in the 1 year in insti) at home.
The instructors are military trained and tend to be really strict. They are really good at what they do and you should try to follow what they say blindly(at least during training sessions)


Things Which You Should Carry:-
It is really cold out here.Thermal wear, jacket/sweatshirts, plenty of socks, a good pair of sports shoes, some eatables,cash(no ATM’s/Google Pay/PayTM){Oh Boy! We really are spoilt with options in insti; aren’t we?}

FOOD OPTIONS:-
They provide us tea in the morning; you can have biscuits with them; then at around 8:30 breakfast is
provided; at 1:00 lunch; at 4:00 tea again and at 8:00 pm dinner again. So rest assured you won't be
hungry.100 meters away there are shops which have plenty of chips and biscuits. On a side note;
at 2100 meter from sea level Patanjali ke biscuits mile (Baba Ramdev Macha Rahe hai :P )
There are also Dhabas which will provide you with decent food (Maggi/paratha/dal sabji etc) in case you are hungry.

For the internet addicts; Your sim cards won't work here:). You’ll need to buy sim card
Airtel/Jio/Idea of 350 bucks. Even after that, you won't receive a signal inside the cottage you will be
staying at. A very good way of detoxification. After 15 days I assure that you'll come out as a physically and mentally fitter person than the one you were before.

Special thanks to IIT Bombay Sports(Pallav, thank you so much and sorry for pestering you so much).
Lots of love to my fellow coursemates Ishika , Saket , Sharang , Chaitanya and Shabdank
for making the course so memorable. The course would't be half as lit without you guys. ;)
To conclude I would say that the best freshie year memories were made here :)

Always remember:- What happens at MAC ; Stays in MAC :P
