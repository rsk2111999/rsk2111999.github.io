Sometime during the 2nd semester, IIT Bombay Sports will release the poster of MAC+BMC. Many
people will preregister for it; most will ditch in the end. Sorry Sports Council; but even you people
are/were clueless for the most part of it. Thus for people who want to be informed travelers
(unlike wanderer’s like us). This is the main motive of this post that future batches participation increases
in these courses and they don’t back out due to insufficient information is given.

The adventure course at JIM is bliss to show your love for mountains. It’s a 13-day package of activities and training. Helps to learn and know more about mountains filled with a bag full of adventure activities.
Adventure course will provide you with basic knowledge regarding the maximum activities. Some of
them being:-

1)Rappelling
2)Rock Climbing
3)River Crossing
4)Camping/Tenting
5)Climbing by Ascender
