This is my first post.I finally have 21 days for myself ; hence I have promised myself to write something everyday on this website.

All this started on a fine Saturday evening.I was having a shower ; and all of a sudden the hostel(the institute for that matter) erupted.
What happened?Well the Dean of Student Affairs(DoSA as we fondly(?) call him) had sent a mail stating that all labs and lectures have been suspended till 31st March
Few minutes into internalizing the chaos it I decided with a senior to book a cab for the next morning.No planning involved nothing.
